    "Qualitatively we know that when the voltage is switched on, the current would increase very quickly, but this leads to a high self-induced emf in the coil. The total voltage in the circuit is therefore lower than the applied voltage. When the current approaches the stationary value, the self-induced voltage decreases and asymptotically tends towards 0.\n",

The same type of function is still a good approximation (see fit function), but both the stationary current and the time constant are smaller than in the simplified model. This has to be expected since the restistance is greater in the stationary situation ($t\\rightarrow\\infty$).\n",

    "The temperature coefficient in the model can also be set to negative values. This corresponds to a resistance which decreases when the current increases (NTC resistor). In this case the deviation from the simplified model is in the opposite direction, i.e. the stationary current and the time constant are smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative deviation is now calculated with respect to the simplified model since we do not have an exact solution to compare to. For large values of the temperature coefficient the deviation is greater than the tolerance of the algorithm, which tells us that the exact solution has a different behaviour than the fit function."
